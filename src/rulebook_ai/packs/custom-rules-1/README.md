# custom-rules-1

A comprehensive rules pack for durable AI-assisted development. It combines project-level ethics/compliance with engineering discipline, code quality, debugging protocol, and architecture guidance.

## What's included
- General rules (ethics, compliance, safety, security, filesystem structure)
- Code rules (linting, errors, OOP, tests)
- Debug rules (triage, dependency/versioning issues)
- Architecture rules (modularity, interfaces, design standards)

## Usage
Add the pack:

```
uvx rulebook-ai packs add custom-rules-1 --project-dir /path/to/project
```

Then sync:

```
uvx rulebook-ai project sync --project-dir /path/to/project
```

## Notes
This pack incorporates core rules from the Sora Autopublisher project and expands them into a broader engineering playbook.
