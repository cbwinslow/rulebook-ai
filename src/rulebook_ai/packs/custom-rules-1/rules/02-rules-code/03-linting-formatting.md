# Linting and formatting

- Prefer project-standard linters and formatters.
- Fix lint and formatting issues at the source.
- Do not disable lint rules unless justified and documented.
- If lint errors occur, run the standard linter and address all violations.
- Avoid temporary suppressions that become permanent.
- Fix spelling errors in code comments, docs, and user-facing text.
